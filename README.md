# ekf_slam
This repository implements an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) based SLAM system for mobile robots. The system estimates the robotâ€™s trajectory and landmark positions simultaneously while handling uncertainty in sensor measurements and motion. Data association resolved using a simple technique to differentiate landmarks using their radius.
